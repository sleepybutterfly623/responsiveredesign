                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>In the heart of downtown Providence, Mokban has served residents quality Korean food since 2017. And it is clear that through their menu items, 
                    presentation, and service within their restaurant, they are committed to quality meals.</p>
                <p>Although their quality speaks volume, I would like to take the time to study how they engage with their customers beyond in-person service:
                    via their website. <b>My objective for this is to study this site and provide suggestions to improve the usability for their customers</b> 
                    through the following: </p>

                <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
                <p>To better understand the usability of Mokban's site, I will direct you to visit their site on your own device 
                    <b><a href="https://www.mokban.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> HERE</a></b>. If you are unable to visit this site, no worries! 
                    Below you will find photos from their site based on my experiences.</p>

                <div class="problems">
                    <h3>Finding the Problems</h3>
                    <h4><i>Usability</i>: how easy is it to use the interface?</h4>
                    <p>For desktop or tablet users, there is poor usability since the footer covers the entire page, making it extremely difficult for any 
                    users to navigate the site. This also affects learnability and efficiency. Furthermore, tablet users are unable to even see headings 
                    because the search bar oftentimes hides it. However, there is great usability for mobile device users who are able to navigate the site 
                    using the headings.</p>
    
                    <h4><i>Memorability</i>: how easy is it to learn how to use the interface?</h4>
                    <p>Given that the site does not have successful usability for desktop and tablet users, memorability is difficult. Users may also face 
                        confusions in the navigation heading where the 'About Us' refers to the restaurant's dining options (lunch specials, dinner, and desserts).
                    </p>
    
                    <h4><i>Conceptual Model</i>: how does the interface reveal to the user how it works?</h4>
                    <p>Because the footer covers the majority of the website for desktop and tablet users, the interface does not show to the user how it should be 
                        used. Conversely, the mobile interface does encourage the users to scroll through and peruse the menu as if they were in the actual restaurant.
                    </p> 
    
                    <h4><i>Accessibility</i></h4>
                    <p>Using <a href=
                        "https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener 
                        noreferrer"> WebAIM WAVE</a>, an online platform to detect potential accessibility problems from an inputted site,  a few errors and alerts were detected and raised:
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Very low contrast</b> between text and background colors (making it difficult for users with low vision)</li>
                    <li><b>Skipping heading level</b> (could cause confusion for users who rely on keyboard navigation and assistive technology)</li>
                    <li><b>Very small text </b> (making it difficult for users with low vision)</li>
                    <li><b>Underlined text</b> (could cause confusion for users since underlined text universally indictes linked text)</li>

                <p>After analyzing and thoroughly determining possible solutions for this interface, I have recreated the homepage of the original Mokban site. 
                    This enables mobile, desktop, and tablet users to have similar usability experiences. To view, please click <b><a href=

                <i>Highlights</i>
                <li>Improving upon usability for desktop and tablet users: moved the footer of the site to the bottom so users can view the navigation bar and content.</li>
                <li>Improving upon low contrast between text and photos: took out photos that would lead to low contrast.</li>
                <li>Improving upon small text: made text larger.</li>
                <li>Underlined text confusion: removed any hints of underlined text that could cause a confusion for users who may think the underlined text are links to another page.</li>
            
            </p>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusions and Findings</h2>
                <p>Based on the original design of the Mokban website, it is apparent that the site was designed with mobile devices in mind since tablet and desktop users are unable to view 
                    their content. Keeping this in mind, it was important to re-design this site with varying screen dimensions so that the usability could be standard across. Going beyond this,
                    it was also important to improve upon the site by rethinking how it could be more accessible to all users. Moving forward, it will be crucial for myself and other designers to 
                    follow the guidelines when designing: usability, memorability, the conceptual model, and accessibility.
